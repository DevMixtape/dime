# Dime

Dime's mission is to

1. Create healthy financial habits through software
2. Open source this entire project and use it as a means of education

## Creating healthy financial habits

We are only as good as our habits in life. Healthy financial habits
include budgeting, saving, and being accountable to financial impulses.
Software can be a modern marvel to create produtive and destructive
habits. I'd love to be able offer a tool to create productive financial
habits and take the negative energy out of personal finance.

## Open Source Education

As I look back on my career, I realize how much I owe to incredible
mentors who I've had the fortune to watch and emulate over the years.
Dime exists as a way of giving back to the software community. I'll
develop the software in public and talk through each step of this
journey with anyone who wants to learn from this shared creative
experience.
